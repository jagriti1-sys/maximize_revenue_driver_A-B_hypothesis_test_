## Problem Statement 

#### In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, maximising revenue is crucial for long-term success and driver satisfaction. Our goal is to use data-driven insight to maximise revenue streams for taxi drivers to meet this need. Our research aims to determine whether payment methods have an impact on fair pricing by focusing on the relationship between payment type and fare amount.

## Objective

#### This project's main goal is to run an A/B test to examine the relationship between the total fare and the method of payment. We utilise Python's hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics to extract valuable insights that can help taxi drivers increase their revenue. In particular, we aim to determine if there is a significant difference in fares for those who pay with credit cards versus those who pay with cash.

## Research Question

#### Is there a relationship between total fare amount and payment type? Is there a relationship between total trip duration and fare amount? and can we move customers towards payment methods that generate higher revenue for drivers, without affecting the CX?
